# Shelf & Fridge Tracker

## Overview

Many people forget what food they have at home. Items get lost in the back of the fridge or on storage shelves. This leads to food going bad and being thrown away. People also buy things they already have because they forgot about them.

The Shelf & Fridge Tracker solves this problem. It helps you keep track of all your food items. You can see what you have, where it is stored, and when it will expire. The app sends you reminders so nothing gets wasted.
