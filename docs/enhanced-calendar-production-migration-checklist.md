# Enhanced Calendar Production Migration Checklist

## Overview

This checklist provides a systematic approach for migrating the enhanced calendar system to production in the FridgeWise application. The migration strategy uses a phased approach to ensure zero downtime and the ability to rollback if needed.

## 🚀 Migration Strategy: **Gradual Rollout**

### **Phase 1**: Silent Deployment (Week 1)

Deploy enhanced calendar alongside existing calendar without user-facing changes.

### **Phase 2**: Beta Testing (Week 2-3)

Enable enhanced calendar for select users or development builds.

### **Phase 3**: Gradual Rollout (Week 4-6)

Progressively move users to enhanced calendar with monitoring.

### **Phase 4**: Full Migration (Week 7+)

Complete migration with optional removal of legacy calendar.
